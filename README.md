# geoffreywperkins.github.io

This is just an HTML file that instantly redirects to https://geoffreywperkins.github.io/Portfolio/, which is my portfolio website built in React.js. The reason this redirect is necessary is because I couldn't get github pages to host my portfolio site at https://geoffreywperkins.github.io when I rebuilt it with React, but I had already sent my resume to companies that said my portfolio was at https://geoffreywperkins.github.io. So, this page redirects anyone with the old URL to the new one
